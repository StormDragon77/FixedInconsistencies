# [Stormilla](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fixed-inconsistencies/)

This github repository was created mainly so I can keep better track of suggestions and bugs

You can suggest or report a bug by opening a new issue in Issues

Stormilla only supports the latest release of Minecraft. The only mod Stormilla supports is the latest release of OptiFine.

If you need to contact Storm to ask about the pack or if you want to use assets, you can do so through Discord: StormDragon77#0675, PMC: StormDragon77 or Twitter: @StormDragn77. You should get a reply within a day.

# Leaving an Issue:

- If an issue is marked as added or fixed but is not in the latest release, it will be in the next one.

------------------------------
BUGS:
- Your bug will be marked invalid/declined if it cannot be reproduced, it isn't a problem relating to this pack or if it is intended
- Bugs can be:
    Missed Textures and Inconsistencies, Texturing Errors, Unnecessary Files within Pack, Typos in Description and Outdated Preview Images on PMC
- Bugs that are not caused by Stormilla will be labeled as ideas. Also if it hasn't been reported yet, please report the bug to Mojang at https://bugs.mojang.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa 
- Describe your bug in detail, include image of the bug if possible and especially if a text description can't visualize the problem well enough
- Specify what platform you are on (Java or bedrock)
- If nessessary, include game version and version of pack you are using.
    - Any version of Stormilla that is not the latest is not supported. Check if your issue persists in the latest release.
    - Old versions of Minecraft and Optifine are not supported so check if the bug is present in the latest release.
- Bugs that I cannot fix:

    - Lighting on tripwire sting on hook model (Mojang bug), end crystal skins for end and nether not rendering (Optifine bug)
------------------------------
SUGGESTIONS:
- Your suggestion will be marked invalid/declined if it strays too far from vanilla, is not an inconsistency or is impossible to add.
- When looking for inconsistencies, I am lookking for 6 things:

     - Outdated Textures, Mismatched Textures, Texture Bugs, Illogical textures, Mixels (Mixed Pixel Resolutions, anything that isn't 16x), Inconsistent Uniformity (a group of blocks/items should either all be uniform or not at all. Ex: dyes, ores)
- Please don't request adding other people's assets. Most of the time the answer is no, I like making the assets myself. You can however request an idea from another pack that you like and I might do my own spin on it.
- Suggestions that are not possible to add as far as I know: 

     - Changing sounds of certain blocks, changing models of armor, fishing bobber, shield
- Suggestions that too drastically change building blocks will not be added (or could potentially be added via addon pack) I don't want this pack to drastically change the look of builds so your builds won't look weird for people who don't have this pack on.

------------------------------
# Old Versions:

Java: 1.3-present (1.0-1.2 are lost since I never saved them on my pc, it would be possible to almost completely recreate them as I do have screenshots and a changelog)

Bedrock: 1.4-present (1.0-1.1 did not have a bedrock version, 1.2-1.3 are lost)
